 * Asynchronously retrieves a list of all persons from the backend API.
 *
 * This method utilizes the `axios` library to make an HTTP GET request to the specified endpoint (`http://localhost:5050/api/persons`).
 * Upon a successful response, it parses the response data and returns it as a JavaScript object.
 *
 * In case of an error during the request or response processing, the error is logged using `console.error` and then re-thrown.
 * This allows the caller to handle the error appropriately.

 *                                On error, the Promise is rejected with the caught error.
 * @throws {Error} Re-throws any error encountered during the API call or data processing.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * async function fetchPersons() {
